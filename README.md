# Multi-Agent-Conversational-System

This project explores the **design and implementation of a multi-agent system**, an architecture increasingly adopted in industry for **complex, goal-oriented tasks**.  
Unlike a single LLM, this system leverages a **team of specialized AI agents** that collaborate to solve problems more effectively.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🔗 Agentic Framework**  
  Built on a popular agentic framework (e.g., [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/)) to **define, orchestrate, and manage** multiple agents seamlessly.

- **🧩 Specialized Agents**  
  Each agent has a **dedicated role** for more structured collaboration:
  - 🕵️ **Researcher Agent** – gathers information and insights.  
  - 🗺️ **Planner Agent** – organizes research into a structured response plan.  
  - ✍️ **Writer Agent** – crafts polished outputs such as reports or summaries.  

- **⚡ Dynamic Task Execution**  
  Agents operate in a **pipeline-like chain**, where the output of one agent becomes the input for the next, ensuring smooth handoffs and contextual consistency.

- **📑 Problem-Solving Application**  
  Demonstrates how agents can **research a topic, plan a response, and generate a complete report**—showcasing a real-world use case.
